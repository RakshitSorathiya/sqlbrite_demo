# SqlBrite Demo Application
A simple demo application for the SqlLite library by Square.

I've been using reactive programming approaches a lot recently (RxJava), so I wanted to give Squares new SqlBrite library a quick try out to see whether it could fit in with the current workflow of projects that I'm working on. The easiest way to do this was to just make a simple application from my boilerplate, this being the result. I thought I'd upload it here incase anyone else is in the same boat and just wants to have a play around, saves you some time I guess!
